Step 1:
We are going to work on a plain-text Sokoban.  Your knowledge about C++, and ncurses should be sufficient to support you to finish this project.  
If you don't know the game Sokoban, here are some demonstrations

1. readMap()
2. showMap()
3. moveWorker()
4. moveBox()
You may also wish to run "/home/solomon/CPP/Sokoban/sokoban.exe" to have a feeling about what the finished program will look like.

Step 2:
Here is a simple example to demonstrate what your program may work.  
Uncompress the Sokoban.zip file, and make sure those "map*.txt" and "*.bmp" files are located in the same directory as "Sokoban.exe".  
Then run the "Sokoban.exe" file.  
Many details of this program can certainly be further polished, but it will be your job to further improve it.
